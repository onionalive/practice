# screenshot-diff

This application requires a custom express server to execute. To use, make sure you have the vue cli installed
and all dependencies downloaded.

Then, run:
```
yarn run build
node server.js
```

When both are done, navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` to use the application.

Stored screenshots will be stored in the `screenshots` directory. You may need to
create this directory if you aren't seeing any output or are getting relevant
errors in the terminal.
